# Data-Analysis-Assessment
## Description 
Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Currently, Rossmann store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. 
Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales 
based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied.

Many internal and external variables may impact sales demand, such as advertisements, promotions, economic situations, competitor behaviour, weather, or special events. This project aims to forecast sales and allows store managers to obtain a great source of information for planning and decision-making. The dataset contains historical data, including sales and store information from 1,115 Rossmann stores. The dataset included several factors (e.g., promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality) which may impact the store sales. We also noticed that some stores in the dataset were temporarily closed for refurbishment. In this report, the sales data will be wrangled and cleaned before we can use it in any analysis. In order to perform these tasks, evaluations will have to be made and justified. We can accurately predict sales trends by analysing store, promotion, and competitor data
